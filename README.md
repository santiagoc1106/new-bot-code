# new-bot-code

#Brief summary of this project prompt in your own words
The project prompt was to make a bot that could be accessed and interacted with in the Discord server.
#Explanation of what you chose and why, and what “being successful” meant to you
I chose to make a bot that could play music, pause it, and resume. Being successful really means just being able to make the bot play and pause music.
#Full explanation of what your program does
My bot can join/leave voice channels at the request of the user. It can also play, pause, and resume music. The bot can also put a gif  and say hello when it is activated. The deets of the server are also posted on the terminal.

-  This source helped me mainly on how to use ffmpeg.exe on my Python code.
#Full explanation of how your code improves upon any skeleton code
I used the code given to me to make my bot more like my bot, so it doesn't behave or have responses like a normal bot. 
Any other info that will help your target audience understand your code
